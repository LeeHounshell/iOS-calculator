RPN iOS-calculator
==================

I'm participating in "CODING TOGETHER: Apps for iPhone & iPad" on
piazza.com this summer.


## Description

This is a RPN style programmable Calculator.
The calculator posted here is functionally extended from CS193P assignment 3.  This calculator
supports variable equations and equation graphing (for equations defined using the 'X' variable).
Each variable button may hold an equation (that can reference other equation variables).
This lets you do complex variable substitutions with up to 6 equations.  Note that for graphs
using 'X' in the main equation, any defined program stored in 'X' is not used in graph generation.
