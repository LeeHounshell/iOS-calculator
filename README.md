iOS-calculator
==============

I'm participating in "CODING TOGETHER: Apps for iPhone & iPad" on
piazza.com this summer.

This is a RPN style programmable Calculator.
The Calculator posted here is functionally extended from assignment 2 with variable equation support.
Each of the variable buttons may hold an equation (that can reference other equation variables).
This lets you do complex variable substitutions for up to 6 equations.
